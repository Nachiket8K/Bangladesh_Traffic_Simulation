# Simulation Logic

## Agents
- Truck agent state (position, route, time, status)

## Routing
- Shortest path / cost function
- Reroute rules (if any) when bridge is down

## Bridge breakage event
- What changes when a bridge is “down”:
  - capacity reduced?
  - travel time inflated?
  - hard closure (reroute forced)?

## Metrics
- Travel time per truck
- Delay accumulation
- Throughput / arrivals
