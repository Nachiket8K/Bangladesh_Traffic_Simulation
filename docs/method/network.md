# Network Construction

## Graph representation
- Nodes = intersections / endpoints
- Edges = road segments
- Bridge edges (tagging `is_bridge`, `bridge_id`)

## Weights / costs
- Baseline travel time
- Bridge delay modeling (when down)

## Validation checks
- Connectivity, components
- Sanity checks on path lengths
