# Bangladesh Transport Network Analysis (EPA1352)

This site documents the work in the **EPA1352 Advanced Simulation Project** on the Bangladesh transport network:
data quality improvements, component-based simulation (Mesa), network model generation (NetworkX), and network-level criticality/vulnerability analysis. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

## What’s in this project

- **Lab / Stage 1 — Data Quality**: identify + fix issues in Bangladesh road (RMMS) and bridge (BMMS) datasets. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
- **Lab / Stage 2 — Component Building (Mesa)**: prototype goods-transport simulation with bridge/ferry delays; initial focus on the N1 corridor (Chittagong–Dhaka). :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
- **Lab / Stage 3 — Network Model Generation (NetworkX + Mesa)**: build an interconnected road network model (e.g., N1 and N2), intersections, two-way traffic, shortest-path routing. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  
- **Lab / Stage 4 — Network Analysis**: quantify criticality (economic importance) and vulnerability (sensitivity) of segments/bridges using simulation results. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}
