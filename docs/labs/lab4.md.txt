# Lab 4 — Network Analysis (Criticality + Vulnerability)

**Goal:** assess which network components matter most (criticality) and which are most sensitive to disruption (vulnerability), using traffic + simulation outputs. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}

## Highlights
- Define criticality and vulnerability metrics
- Use simulation experiments to quantify disruption impacts
- Visualize high-traffic / high-risk segments :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}

## Deliverables
- [Report PDF](../assets/reports/assignment-4-network-analysis.pdf)
